# Human-Activity-Recogntion-using-Smartphone-sensors
Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Sensors" is a cutting-edge project that utilizes the power of machine learning and smartphone sensor data to accurately classify and recognize human activities. By leveraging the rich and diverse data collected from various sensors on modern smartphones, including accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, this project aims to develop robust algorithms that can automatically detect and classify different human activities, such as walking, running, sitting, standing, and more.The project involves preprocessing and analyzing large amounts of sensor data, extracting relevant features, and applying advanced machine learning techniques,  to train and optimize accurate activity recognition models. These models can then be deployed on smartphones or other mobile devices to provide real-time, on-device activity recognition capabilities, without the need for constant internet connectivity.
